The logo must look digitally printed onto fabric, not overlaid:

– slight ink absorption into fibers
– soft edges (no hard vector outlines)
– micro texture bleeding following fabric weave
– subtle ink density variations
– minor print imperfections (real POD behavior)
– no embossing, no embroidery, no 3D raised effect

The print must react naturally to:
– fabric wrinkles
– garment stretching
– lighting direction
– shadows and folds

The logo must bend, distort and break only due to fabric movement, never by repositioning.

Allowed changes ONLY:

– model pose
– camera angle
– lighting setup
– natural garment wrinkles and tension

Photography & styling:

– neutral studio or real lifestyle background
– professional fashion photography lighting
– realistic cotton / jersey fabric texture
– commercial e-commerce quality
– true-to-life color reproduction

The logo must stay physically attached to the garment surface at all times.

Output only the final mockup image.
No explanations. No text.

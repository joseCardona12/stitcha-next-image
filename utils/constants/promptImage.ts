Create a high-resolution, photorealistic apparel mockup.

Use the provided image as a strict reference for logo placement.
The logo must remain EXACTLY in the same position relative to garment seams, folds, and proportions.
Do not move, scale, rotate, warp, re-center, or correct the logo in any way.
The off-center placement is intentional and must be preserved.

Only vary:
– model pose
– camera angle
– lighting
– natural fabric wrinkles

The logo must stay locked to the same garment area at all times.
Neutral studio background, professional fashion lighting, realistic fabric texture, commercial mockup quality.

Respond concisely.
Do not explain the result. Only generate the mockup.
